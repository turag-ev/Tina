 * \section bluetoothmodule Bluetooth module
 * This module offers various ways to exchange data via bluetooth between peers in a
 * thread-safe and flexible manner. It is implemented as an abstract base class
 * which needs to be extended with hardware specifics.
 *
 * All the time-consuming communication work is done
 * within a thread while all public access functions return within a minimum of time.
 * It builds on top of a set of low-level
 * functions that need to be implemented in the derived subclass. This abstraction layer is responsible
 * for mapping the bluetooth hardware addresses to peer IDs which start with 0, for piping
 * received input into the appropriate high-level functions and for writing data back to
 * the hardware. The mapping of connected peers is limited to 256.
 *
 * This module requires the header <tina/bluetooth_config.h> to be availaible which needs to define
 * the following Symbols:
 * - BLUETOOTH_NUMBER_OF_PEERS
 * - BLUETOOTH_NUMBER_OF_RPCS
 * - BLUETOOTH_NUMBER_OF_DATA_SINKS
 * - BLUETOOTH_NUMBER_OF_DATA_PROVIDERS
 * - BLUETOOTH_THREAD_STACK_SIZE
 * - BLUETOOTH_THREAD_PRIORITY
 * - BLUETOOTH_THREAD_RPC_WAIT_MS
 *
 * \subsection Implementingsubclasses Implementing subclasses
 * When implementing the subclass you should make sure it can't be instantiated more than once
 * as this wouldn't make any sense. For this purpose you should override the get()-function. Let's
 * look at a small example. First we need some includes:
 * \snippet bluetooth.h Includes
 * Then we declare our subclass:
 * \snippet bluetooth.h class
 * There are a few interesting things to consider with this code:
 * - the constructor is protected. This inhibits the creation of any instances from outside the class.
 * - we have a static variable instance_ that holds our one and only instance of our class
 * - we have the static function get() which returns a pointer to this instance
 *
 * You should be aware that implementing a singleton with a globally allocated static like in this case
 * is problematic if you have other singletons that are implemented in the same way depend on it.
 * But at least it's thread-safe.
 *
 *
 * \subsection rpc RPCs
 * Every peer can offer RPCs. You need to register them at the bluetooth module with
 * an ID that starts with zero. After registering the RPC any connected peer that knows the correct RPC id can call
 * the RPC. This will then result in the callback function getting called. The calling
 * peer can pass along an argument of 8 bytes size. A maximum number of 64 RPCs are supported.
 *
 * If you call an RPC, it is enqueued for transmit. The bluetooth thread handles transmitting
 * the data and takes care, that the call actually happens. Thus calling a RPC is considered
 * error-free and the function invoking the RPC returns quickly. At the same time RPCs can not
 * return any results.
 *
 * \subsection data Arbitrary data
 * If you want to transceive larger amounts of data you can define a so-called data sink.
 * It consists of a storage buffer that is associated with a data sink id. A number of up to
 * 64 data sinks is supported. Any other peer
 * is allowed to transmit data to into this data sink. To do that, this peer has to configure
 * a data provider with the target's id and data sink id.
 * If you want to push data from a data provider to a data sink, the data is copied into the data
 * provider's storage. Then the bluetooth thread will transmit the data. The receiving peer will
 * then copy the data into its storage buffer. Some other thread can then access this data.
