 *
 * @section IM-Statemachine
 * This module offers the possibility to define flexible finite statemachines
 * that are able reflect the usual requirements for mechanical state flows.
 *
 * The central idea about the internal mechanics statemachines is to have special
 * IM-thread running that works on the continuous execution of the statemachines.
 * Some other thread that makes use of the IM-module starts and stops them, receives events
 * concerning their stateflow and to some extent controls the way they are executed.
 * For that reason the end-user interface is strictly thread-safe and the module was
 * designed to be used in a multi-threaded environment, but that is not a requirement.
 *
 * Statemachines consist of states. States are defined by a state-function that
 * evaluates the state's precondition and a transition-function which evaluates
 * the conditions required to enter the appropriate follow-state. Both functions are virtual
 * functions and part of the interface of an abstract base State-class which have
 * to be implemented in inherited State-classes.
 *
 * On details about what state- and transition-functions are and what to keep in mind when implementing
 * them, see: \link State::state_function \endlink and \link State::transition_function \endlink .
 *
 * \subsection features Features
 *  - Statemachines can be started and stopped.
 *  - Multiple statemachines can run concurrently.
 *  - Statemachines can emit specified events to a given eventqueue while being active.
 *  - The execution of a statemachine
 * can be part of the stateflow of another one.
 *  - When started, a statemachine can get an argument, which is valid as long
 * as the execution lasts and is available in all associated states.
 *  - A state can wait for a specific external signal. Signals are only valid
 * in the transition-function of the currently active state.
 *
 * \subsection defstatemachines Creating statemachines
 * Let's look at how to create a simple statemachine that works with some piece
 * of hardware and consists of four states:
 *
 * \dot
 * digraph example {
 * rankdir=LR;
 * node [shape=record, fontname=Helvetica, fontsize=10];
 * entry [ label = "entry", shape="diamond" ];
 * prepare [ label="Prepare hardware"];
 * start [ label="working: step 1"];
 * work [ label="working: step 2"];
 * end [ label="Tidy up & finish"];
 * finished [label="stopped", shape="diamond"];
 * entry -> prepare -> start -> work -> end -> finished;
 * work -> start;
 * prepare -> prepare [ arrowhead="open", style="dashed" ];
 * start -> start [ arrowhead="open", style="dashed" ];
 * work -> work [ arrowhead="open", style="dashed" ];
 * end -> end [ arrowhead="open", style="dashed" ];
 * }
 * \enddot
 *
 * It's mainly linear. In the third state there is the possibility to either restart the
 * working cycle or let the statemachine finish its work.
 *
 * The behaviour of a statemachine is defined by its states and how they are connected.
 * So you should create a new source file, including at least the statemachine-header:
 * \snippet im_statemachine_states_example.cpp Includes
 *
 * Because states are usually defined for one particular purpose while sharing the need
 * to work on some hardware or device, it is useful to first declare a base state
 * the actual states will inherit from. In our example each state will be able to access
 * some piece of hardware with a void-Pointer. In real code this should of course be a pointer
 * to a class.
 * \snippet im_statemachine_states_example.cpp Basestate
 *
 * Now we can define the states we need to build our statemachine. Each state has to
 * implement the state- and the transition-function. You should also note that every
 * state owns one or more pointers to its possible follow states with the exception
 * of the last one. The last state doesn't need such a pointer because it will return
 * a special value, leading to the termination of the statemachine.
 * \snippet im_statemachine_states_example.cpp States
 *
 * Now we can implement the behaviour of our statemachine. Each state owns a state-fumction
 * that is executed once when the state becomes active. Return false in this function
 * to indicate an error and have the whole statemachine cancelled. he second function
 * is the transition-function which is called as long as you return the this-pointer. There
 * are some special return values (see State::transition_function). Keep in mind, that neither
 * the state- nor the transition are allowed to contain code or functions that take an
 * unconsiderable amount of time to finish. Both functions should return quickly.
 * \snippet im_statemachine_states_example.cpp Functions
 *
 * Now, as we have complete state classes, we need to define some instances of them and
 * connect them according to our state flow. Because we want to use our states for two
 * statemachines that behave the same but work on different hardware, we do this in a
 * separate namespace. Take note of the extern declarations before the actual instantiations.
 * They are necessary to define the states in the correct logical order. Otherwise we would
 * get compiler errors.
 * \snippet im_statemachine_states_example.cpp Instances
 *
 * Now all tht's left to do is putting our states together into a statemachine. Not all
 * arguments are required, most are optional. For details see Statemachine::Statemachine.
 * \snippet im_statemachine_states_example.cpp Statemachine
 *
 * At the very end don't forget to close your namespaces and everything will work well:
 * \snippet im_statemachine_states_example.cpp Rest
 *
 * Now you can put your statemachine in some header file and use it wherever needed.
 *
 * \subsection communicationwithevents Communication with events
 * Because the statemachine module was designed to work in a multi-threaded environment
 * it can make use of an Eventqueue-object to inform a different thread about the status of
 * running statemachines.
 *
 * The eventqueue to communicate with can be set globally, or each time when a statemachine
 * is started. It is also possible to start a statemachine in silent mode, then it will not
 * emit any event.
 *
 * Every statemachine is defined with a set of three standard events, which are emitted
 * automatically:
 * - eventOnSuccessfulInitialization
 * - eventOnGracefulShutdown
 * - eventOnErrorShutdown
 *
 * Additionally you can use State::emitEvent to generate events specific to your statemachine.
 *
 * \subsection usingstatemachinesinotherstatemachines Using a statemachine in other statemachines
 * It's possible to start and stop statemachines within the state- or transition-function of states
 * and additionally from other threads because the statemachine-interface is fully thread-safe. Yet
 * as there is no way to receive events from the started child statemachine in the parent statemachine,
 * you are limited to use the the status-functions of the statemachine. A possible
 * use-case could look like this:
 * - in the state-function of one of the parent statemachine's states, start the child statemachine
 * - in the corresponding transition function use Statemachine::isActive() to wait for the child
 * statemachine to finish and decide which state to activate next depending on how the child
 * ended. You can find out whether it caught an error with Statemachine::getStatus().
 *
 * Still, there are some issues to keep in mind if you want to make use of the concept
 * of statemachines-in-statemachines:
 * - Always start the statemachine in silent-mode (Statemachine::startSilent), even if the statemachine was defined without
 * standard events, because the states could still contain emitEvent-calls. This is of course
 * UNLESS you want the statemachine to emit events to the eventqueue, but this practice is
 * highly discouraged.
 * - Statemachines (at least those who emit events) should be exclusive to either one spearate thread
 * or the statemachine thread. Consider the following example: some thread starts statemachine A.
 * %Statemachine A starts statemachine B in the recommended silent mode and runs for a good while.
 * Now the thread that started A suddenly needs to start B which normally emits an initialized-event.
 * But B is already running - in silent mode. So the thread will never know the story about B and
 * probably wait forever. You might say: then A shouldn't start B in silent mode, but that's even worse
 * in the opposite case: now B suddenly emits events which the thread did never expect and it might get
 * totally confused.
 *
 * To wrap it all up: statemachines-in-statemachines is fine and good, but if you use it, start them silent
 * and keep all statemachines separate (unless you can really guarantee that it doesn't emit events and still then
 * there remain some issues).
 *
 *
 * \subsection signalsandarguments Signals and arguments
 * When you start a statemachine, it's possible to pass an argument along. This is an integer value
 * whose meaning depends on the statemachine. You might define some enum and use the argument
 * to customize the behaviour of the statemachine with a few distinct modes or you could use it
 * as a continuous value which might be the angle of the axis of some robot arm. If you need more than
 * what fits into 4 byte, you could supply a pointer but then you have to make sure that the corresponding
 * data doesn't get touched while the statemachine is running.
 *
 * The argument of a statemachine is available in both the state- and the transition-functions of all states
 * that are part of the statemachine.
 *
 * Signals offer a similar functionality with the difference that they only live for the time of the current
 * state still being active. You can only push a signal to a statemachine, once it is running. The signal will then
 * be available only in the transition-function of the currently active state. You can pass an argument along
 * with the signal, but that is optional.
 *
 * A likely use-case of the signals (a state that delays the stateflow until it receives any signal) is
 * readily available for use with the class WaitForSignalState.
