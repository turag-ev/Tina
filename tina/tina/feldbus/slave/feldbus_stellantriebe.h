/**
 *  @brief		Implements slave side TURAG feldbus für Stellantriebe support
 *  @file		feldbus_stellantriebe.h
 *  @date		17.11.2013
 *  @author		Martin Oemus <martin@oemus.net>
 *
 * This module implements support for the TURAG Feldbus für Stellantriebe device protocol. 
 * This device protocol was designed to meet the communication requirements of 
 * usual mechanical actors. 
 * 
 * As a main feature it is possible to define a table
 * of values within the device's firmware which is called command set. 
 * This table is used by the protocol implementation to enable 
 * read and or write access to these values. For each entry of the command set
 * you can adjust the length, write access and a factor which needs to be applied to 
 * the returned raw value to get a value of the correct physical dimension.
 * This is useful to avoid expensive floating point operations in potentially 
 * slow devices. The different possible configuration options are defined in the protocol
 * specification header. The actual location in memory of an entry of the command
 * set is given with a void pointer to the corresponding address.
 * 
 * Additionally it is possible to supply a human-understandable description
 * for each value which needs to be supplied in a separate array of strings.
 *
 * You should be aware of the fact that communication-caused access to the values
 * of the command set does always happen within interrupt context. This has 2 implications:
 *  - for read-only values you need to protect every write access that happens within the device's 
 *    firmware in main context to this value by disabling all interrupts before the actual write.
 *    if your device runs on an architecture whose register size is smaller than the value in question.
 *  - for writable values you additionally need to declare the variable as volatile.
 *
